StartEngine Crowdfunding, Inc.
Alternative Finance Domain



## Overview and Origin

**Name of company** – StartEngine Crowdfunding, Inc.

**When was the company incorporated?** – March 19, 2014

**Who are the founders of the company?** – Howard Marks (Co-founder, CEO and Director) and Ronald Miller (Co-founder, Executive Chairman and Director)

**How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?** – From envisioning a way to take advantage of the 2012 JOBS Act which is intended to help solve the funding problems that early-stage and small companies encounter, by giving them access to a completely new source of funds: their friends and families, customers, fans and other believers.

**How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?** – As of 12/31/2019 the Company’s activities have been funded from the sale of preferred stock ($8,156,395), a Regulation A offering ($9,680,834), and revenues generated from operations.  The Company is currently in the midst of a subsequent Regulation A offering whereby the Company has raised and additional $11,621,631 as of 9/14/2020.


## Business Activities:

**What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?** – StartEngine aims to revolutionize the startup financing model.  Small businesses are the backbone of the US economy.  They account for 65% of new jobs in the private sector and employ over 58 million people. In fact, there are nearly 6 million small businesses in the US.  Small companies need funding in order to grow, yet venture capitalists will invest in less than 1% of them.  What are the other 99% of companies supposed to do to access funding?  StartEngine provides an answer with one radical idea:   What if anyone could invest in startups and be an angel investor?

The Company hope's to solve the issue with the entire startup funding ecosystem by builing a platform where:

* Companies that need funding can raise capital.

* Everyday people can make startup investments.

* Investors can trade startup investments on a public market.

The Company wants to level the playing field and make startup investing accessible to everyone.


**Who is the company's intended customer?** – Startups and early growth companies on the one hand and everyday people who heretofore have not have access to investing in such companies on the other hand.

**Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?** – According to the SEC, for the period from July 1, 2018 to June 30, 2019, the size of the various issuer markets is:

* Regulation A -- $800 million
* Regulation Crowdfunding -- $54 million
* Regulation D (Rule 506(c) private placements) -- $210 billion

**What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)** – The following are several of the important qualities that distinguish StartEngine from other crowdfunding platforms:

* 	Their CEO Howard Marks has a proven track record of building successful businesses with Activision.
* 	They have renowned businessman Kevin O’Leary (Shark Tank) as our strategic advisor.
* 	They have launched more companies than any of their competitors.
* 	They are the 10th fastest growing private company in California, according to the Inc. 5000 Series list.
* 	They plan to launch a trading platform for investors. Such a marketplace does not yet exist in the US.
* 	They offer unique services, such as StartEngine Secure for capitalization table management and StartEngine Promote for digital marketing.
* 	They are the only platform to use Regulation A+ to raise funding for itself, and they have over 9,000 shareholders to spread the word about their business.

**Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?** – Depending on the type of offering being made, the Company currently operates as a technology platform connecting issuers and investors and as a Regulation Crowdfunding funding portal.

**What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?** – There have been over 100,000 investors on StartEngine and 48% of investments are from repeat investors.

**How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?** – StartEngine has raised more money for crowdfunding / early stage issuers than any other alternative finance funding source.


## Recommendations

**If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)** – The Company should expand through vertical integration of products and services that would increase their investors’ probability of success.  In addition, they should bring inhouse custodial services and eliminate their reliance on Prime Trust.

**Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?** – Less reliance on a third-party vendor and the ability to make additional margin.  Prior to becoming a FINRA broker dealer they legally couldn’t provide these services, now they can.

What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

**Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?** – According to StackShare, Prime Trust uses the following technology platforms:

Application & Data
* jQuery (JavaScript Library)
* Bootstrap (HTML, CSS, and JS for popular UI components and interactions)
* Chart.js (Charts for designers and developers)

Utilities
* Google Tag Manager (update tags and code snippets on your website or mobile app)

Business Tools
* Google Fonts (Making the web more beautiful, fast, and open through great typography)
* Font Awesome (The internet's most popular icon toolkit)
